WILL A SWIFT PLUGIN SLOW DOWN MY SITE?

No. Swift Ad has been rigorously tested and precisely engineered to deliver a quick and seamless experience for everyone involved.

WHAT DOES A SWIFT AD LOOK LIKE?

It looks exactly like every thing else on your site looks like. It matches the look and feel of your site perfectly.

That my friend we can help you with. Please click, here, and visit our handy-dandy walkthrough. You can also contact out service department and get a real live person whenever you would like.

WHAT IS AD LANDER?

It is a technology platform for delivering ads that is immune to ad blockers. The platform also includes robust analytics and split (A/B) testing tools.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SWIFT IMPRESSIONS AND AD LANDER?

Swift Impressions is the parent company. The Swift Impressions platform was designed to give publishers much more control over what was published on their websites through ad and sponsored content networks. We built Ad Lander as an enterprise product and we have adapted it to something for mass distribution.

HOW DOES AD LANDER WORK?

Basically… The Ad Lander technology serves ad content as organic content. From an Ad Blocker perspective there is zero difference between the two and therefore it cannot block an ad. There is a little more to it than that, for example we add a transparency layer but the above is essentially still true regardless.

WHICH PRODUCTS RUN THE AD LANDER TECHNOLOGY?

Swift Ad runs the Ad Lander technology if you are willing to pay for it. It’s worth it, and that is not a biased statement. (Jedi hand wave)

IS THE AD LANDER TECHNOLOGY FUTURE PROOF?

Absolutely! There is literally no programmatic method, and there never will be, that an ad blocker can utilize to understand when an Ad Lander ad is an ad. Ultimately, it’s all content and we serve it organically.

WHO OWNS THE PATNET FOR THE AD LANDER TECHNOLOGY?

Swift Impressions holds a patent-pending on the Ad Lander technology in the US. Additionally, Swift Impressions has 18 months from September 2016 to file in the UK, EU, Japan and 13 other countries. We intend to file very soon.

ARE THERE ANY LATENCY ISSUES WITH SWIFT AD?

Nope! Our tests so far have shown it to actually be faster.

DOES THE PLUGIN INCREASE MY SERVER LOAD?

Yes. There is a minor, generally manageable increase on your server load.

WHAT IS FREQUENCY CAPPING?

Frequency capping is a fancy word used by industry experts meaning the total number of times any given piece of content is viewable by any one person.

For example, if you create a Swift Ad and set the frequency capping to 3, the maximum number of times any given user will be able to see that post is 3 separate times. After that, it will be placed back to it’s normal place in your feed.

WHAT ARE IMPRESSIONS?

Impressions are how many times a piece of content has been viewed.

WHAT IS MEANT BY GEO TARGETING?

Geo targeting refers the ability to place restrictions a post in a manner that only certain visitors from any given location or locations will be able to see it.

For example, if an advertiser would like to run a sponsored post on your site for a wedding expo in Colorado. I doesn’t make sense for the advertiser to pay for the impressions coming for visitors in New York.

Geo targeting allows for highly targeted and effects advertising.
